Confusion matrix or error matrix
It is a simple useful tool for understanding the performance of a classification model.

Confusion Matrix Representation:
0 in x-axis is negative and 1 is positive
TN - True Negative having 0 on 0 is true but negative, so it is True Negative TN.
FP - 1 on 0 is postive but false so False Positive.

Accuracy = TN + TP / TN + TP + FP + FN
Error = FN + FP / N  -> (N = TN + TP + FP + FN)

FP = Type 1
FN = Type 2 error
If in case of critical cases the model predicts for patient to not having cancer even in case of having it. This calls for model cancellation.
