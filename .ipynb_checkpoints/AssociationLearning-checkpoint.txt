Association rule learning is a machine learning technique used to discover interesting relationships or patterns in large datasets.
Often applied to transactional data where items are bought or used together.

Association rule learning works on the concept of if else statement,
If A Then B
If element is called antecedent and then statement is called as consequent.

Key factors:
a. Support -> Straightforward calculation of frequently bought items.
                Support(A) = Transactions(A) / Total Transactions

b. Confidence -> This will tell us how confident (based on data) we can be that an item will be purchased, given that another item has been purchased.
conf(X=>Y) = P(Y|X)
           = supp(X intersect Y) / supp(X) # here the comparision of denominator supp(Y) decides for which arrangement to choose. 
           = number of transactions containing X and Y / no. of transactions containing X

c. Lift ->
Given that different items are bought at different frequencies(strong association)
lift(X=>Y) = supp(X intersect Y) / supp(X) * supp(Y)
lift > 1 means that two items are more likely to be bought together
lift < 1 means that two items are more likely to be bought separately
lift = 1 means that there is no association between two items
