Used to group the dataset into a cluster and is also known as HCA Hierarchical Cluster Analysis.
We develop a hierarchy of clusters in tree form known as dendrogram.

Dendogram is a tree-like struture that is mainly used to store each step as a memory that the HC aldorithm performs.
In dendogram plot, the Y-axis shows the Euclidean distances between the data points and the x-axis shows all the data points of the dataset.

Two aproaches for HCA:
a. Agglomerative -> bottom-up approach, individual datasets to clusters.
b. Divisive -> reverse of Agglomerative, single cluster dividing into smallers.

Measure of the Distance between clusters:
Linkage methods are the ways to calculate the distance between clusters:
a. Single Linkage -> considers minimum distance
b. Complete Linkage -> considers maximum
c. Average Linkage
d. Centroid Linkage
