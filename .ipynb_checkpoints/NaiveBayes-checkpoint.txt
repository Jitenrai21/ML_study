Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on bayes theorem.
Bayes theorem is a probability theory.
Naive means the occurance of a certain feature.

Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B).P(B) = P(B|A).P(A)
P(A|B) = P(B|A).P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) -> probability of A when obeserved event B.

Naive Bayes Model Types:
a. Gaussian -> Input data in normal distribution curvature.
b. Multinomial -> Multinomial distribution and discrete data.
c. Bernoulli -> Features are binary(boolean) varicbles
