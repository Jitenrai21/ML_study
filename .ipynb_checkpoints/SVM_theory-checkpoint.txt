#SVM is the most popular Supervised learning algorithm.
#Simple SVM for linear data
#SVM works for both classification and regression.
#SVM works by creating two support vectors which are two datapoints that helps to split dataset for classification.
#marginal plane or hyperplane are lines created on support vectors.
#maximum margin or separable line is the situtated at center of hyperplanes.(by the mean of hyperlines)
#Hard margin -> no datapoint between the hyperplanes
#Soft margin -> inaccuracies

For non-linear data
We use Kernel SVM
Kernel functions transform input data into higher dimensional space
kernel function: linear, polynomial, Gaussian RBF, Sigmoid
