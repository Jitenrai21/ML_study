Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):
Parallel Technique to improve your model.
Uses subsets(bags) to get a fair idea of the distribution(Complete set).
Subsets are given different models each.
eg, subset1 : dt1
    subest2 : dt2
    subset3 : dt3
In Classification: combined prediction is the mode of the answers.
In Rgression: Answer comes from the average.

Bagging Algorithms:
a. Bagging Meta-Estimator
b. Random forest

Bagging Meta-Estimator:
Ensembling algorithm used for both Bagging Classifier and Bagging Regressor problems.

Random Forest:
Base estimator in random forests are decision trees.
