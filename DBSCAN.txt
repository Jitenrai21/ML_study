Density-based Spatial clustering
DBSCAN can be any shape, which can deal with some special cases that other methods cannot.

Features:
1. Minimum Point minpoint = 4 (points in the circle)
2. Epsolin epn(r) = 0.5 (radius of circle around any datapoint)

a. Core point (center point of the circle, is included in counting of the minimum point)
b. Boundary point -> circles are created overlapping also and at the corner when, no. of point < minpoint is the boundary point
c. Noise point -> also known as outlier, single datapoints and no other circle points
