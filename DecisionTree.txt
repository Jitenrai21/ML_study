Decision tree works on CART algorithm CART -> Classification and Regression Tree algorithm
Decision tree is a non linear separable algorithm.

Root node: Divided into two or more homogenous sets.
Splitting: Process of dividing nodes into sub nodes.
Decision Node: subnodes splits into further subnodes.
Leaf node: Terminal node
Pruning: Opposite of splitting, removing sub-nodes.
Branch/sub-tree: a subsection of the entire tree

Entropy is a metric to measure the impurity in a given attribute.
Entropy(s) = -P(yes)log2P(yes) - P(no)log2P(no)

Information gain is the measurement of changes in entropy. Calculates how much info a feature provides us about a class.
Info Gain = Entropy(s) - [(Weighted Avg)*Entropy(each feature)]
