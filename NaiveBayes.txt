Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on bayes theorem.
Bayes theorem is a probability theory.
Naive means the occurance of a certain feature.

Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B).P(B) = P(B|A).P(A)
P(A|B) = P(B|A).P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) -> probability of A when obeserved event B.
P(A∣B): Posterior probability — the probability of class A given features B

The "naive" part assumes that all features 
𝑋1,𝑋2,..,𝑋𝑛 are independent of each other given the class C. This simplifies the likelihood 
P(X∣C) as:
P(X∣C)=P(X1∣C)⋅P(X2∣C)⋅...⋅P(Xn∣C)
This assumption reduces computational complexity, making the algorithm highly efficient.

Naive Bayes Model Types:
a. Gaussian(for continuous data) -> Input data in normal distribution curvature.
b. Multinomial -> Multinomial distribution and discrete data.
c. Bernoulli -> Features are binary(boolean) varicbles
