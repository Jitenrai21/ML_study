Overfitting is the case where the difference between the accuracy score of the training set and testing set is high.

Pruning decreases the size of the decision tree.

Pre pruning is the static way of giving a max depth to the decisiontreeclassifier class. i.e dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2

Posting pruning is done by checking the
for i in range(1,20):
    dt2 = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=i)
    dt2.fit(x_train,y_train)
    print(dt2.score(x_train,y_train),dt2.score(x_test,y_test),i)
    #this gives the best option for max_depth depending on the lowest difference
